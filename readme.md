This code is written when I was learning PHP+MySQL（MariaDB）course on Udemy. The base template is provided by the course and I made some changes for that.

I learned basic PHP and Web development technology such as HTTP, Cookie, and Session.

As mentioned earlier, the database used is MySQL. Using XAMPP to set up a web server.  

Take the mini_bbs.sql file to restore the database. Notice, it includes test(sample) data.
